# EZHeader

EZHeader is going to be a react library that makes creating clean, professional-looking, responsive headers a simple task. The end goal is to be able to pass in just a few
props in order to extract away the complexity of making great looking and mobile friendly animations and layouts.

This library is NOT production ready.

Uses concepts and ideas taken from the course https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-creating-reusable-components/table-of-contents

animation code for hamburger toggles will be taken from https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/ anything I use will be ported to fit the project structure.

I will not be hosting the docs until I have a significant ammount of the library finished.
